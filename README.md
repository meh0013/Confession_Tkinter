# Confession_Tkinter
Simple Tkinter application to ask out someone in a way that they cannot deny...

Uses Tkinter and customtkinter to create a simple window with two buttons: 
Yes and No.

The "No" button constantly changes position using the random function and the event that tracks the mouse. 

The "Yes" button, as of now, removes the existing buttons and declares a statement.
